# Gym-Record

I've copied and pasted the data from the my Trento app which records when I enter and exit the gym. I've cleaned the data, taking into times I've entered the gym and left quickly because I'd left something in the car. The aim is to visualise how much time I actually spend in the gym, and how often I go. The exercise is a simple brain teaser to keep my coding skills up whilst I write my thesis (in other words: procrastination)
